 ## Description

    Welcome to my Team profile generator! This application was created with Node.js using the build in package
    fs(File System), third-party packages Jest (for testing) and Inquirer (for collectin user input). This
    application is ran from the back-end and does not have a deployed page however, 
    once running the application it does create an html page that can be view in the browser!
